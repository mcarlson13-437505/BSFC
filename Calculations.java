//calculates mass of fuel consumed based on BSFC value from csv array
/* Units for Calculations:
 * BSFC (bsfc)= g/kWhr
 * mass (m)= kg
 * Vehicle speed (v) = mi/hr
 * engine speed (rpm) = rev/min
 * distance (dist) = mi
 * torque (torque) = Nm
 * 
 * EQUATION
 * mass = bsfc*torque*rpm*dist/v
